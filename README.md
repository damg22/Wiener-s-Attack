Wiener's Attack
===============

Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener's_attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener's_attack) to know more about Wiener's attack.

We basically follow the paper to write this Java program to attack certain types of RSA. This is also the reason why the private key of RSA should be long enough.

Refer to "Readme.pdf" within this project to understand the test cases.
